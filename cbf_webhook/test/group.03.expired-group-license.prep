Ensure there is a group licence with token 'hellothere'
The group licence should have expired, but have licences remaining

For example ...

    select * from civicrm_value_group_license_32;

    update civicrm_value_group_license_32
    set group_license_token_161 = 'hellothere',
        group_license_expiry_162 = 'PAST-06-24 00:00:00',
        group_licenses_remaining_163 = 100
    where entity_id = NNNNNN;
